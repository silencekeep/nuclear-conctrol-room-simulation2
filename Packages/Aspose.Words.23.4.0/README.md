[Aspose.Words for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/net/) is a class library that can be used by C#, F#, VB.NET developers for a variety of document-processing tasks, including document generation, modification, converting, and rendering. Our library is self-sufficient and doesn't depend on any third-party software, such as Microsoft Word, OpenOffice, and similar office suites. 

This package can be used to develop applications for a vast range of operating systems (Windows, Linux, macOS, iOS, Android) and [platforms](https://docs.aspose.com/words/net/supported-platforms/) such as [Windows Azure](https://docs.aspose.com/words/net/windows-azure-platform/), Xamarin.Android, Xamarin.iOS, Xamarin.Mac. You can build both 32-bit and 64-bit software, including ASP.NET, WCF, and WinForms. Also, you can use our library via COM Interop from ASP, PHP, Perl, and Python programming languages.

> *Please note*: our library implies the use of [.NET programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_CLI_languages), compatible with CLI infrastructure. If you require a corresponding native library for C++, you can download it from [here](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspose.Words.Cpp/). The Python version you can download from [here](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-words/).

## Getting Started

So, you probably want to jump up and start coding your document processing application on C#, F# or Visual Basic right away? Let us show you how to do it in a few easy steps.

Run ```Install-Package Aspose.Words``` from the Package Manager Console in Visual Studio to fetch the NuGet package.
If you want to upgrade to the latest package version, please run ```Update-Package Aspose.Words```.

You can run the following code snippets in C# to see how our library works. Also feel free to check out the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/aspose-words/Aspose.Words-for-.NET) for other common use cases.

### Create a DOCX using C#

Aspose.Words for .NET allows you to create a blank Word document and add content to the file.

```c#
// Create a Word document.
Document doc = new Document();

// Use a DocumentBuilder instance to add content to the file.
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);

// Write a new paragraph to the document.
builder.Writeln("This is an example of a Word document created in C#");

// Save it as a DOCX file. The output format is automatically determined by the filename extension.
doc.Save(dir + "OutputWordDocument.docx");
```

### Create a PDF in C#

Aspose.Words for .NET allows you to create a new PDF file and fill it with data.

```c#
// Create a PDF document.
Document pdf = new Document();

// Use a DocumentBuilder instance to add content to the file.
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(pdf);

// Write a new paragraph to the document.
builder.Writeln("This is an example of a PDF document created using C#");

// Save it as a PDF file.
pdf.Save(dir + "OutputDocument.pdf");
```

### Convert a Word document to HTML with C#

You can convert Microsoft Word to PDF, XPS, Markdown, HTML, JPEG, TIFF, and other file formats. The following snippet demonstrates the conversion from DOCX to HTML:

```c#
// Load a Word file from the local drive.
Document doc = new Document(dir + "InputWordDocument.docx");

// Save it to HTML format.
doc.Save(dir + "OutputHtmlDocument.html");
```

### Import a PDF and save as a DOCX via C#

In addition, you can import a PDF file into your .NET application and export it as a DOCX format file without the need to install Microsoft Word:

```c#
// Load a PDF file from the local drive.
Document pdf = new Document(dir + "InputDocument.pdf");

// Save it to DOCX format.
pdf.Save(dir + "OutputWordDocument.docx");
```
